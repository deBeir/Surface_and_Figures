# OOP PROJECT: SURFACE&FIGURES

## ABOUT
This was my first OOP project for my programming class.
Just a simple program that creates a surface with a given dimension and allows the user to insert circles and rectangles inside of said surface. 

For this project three classes were created:
- *__Surface__*: generates a surface where the figures will be inserted. Has several methods to place them in valid positions - figures cannot be placed outside the edges of our surface and two or more figures cannot overlap.
- *__Rectangle__*: creates a rectangle.
- *__Circle__*: creates a circle.

There's also a *test* module developed to test all functionalities of the 3 classes. 
__Please note__, this is a beginner project, so many aspects may be (greatly) improved. For example, the circles are placed like they're squares instead of actual circles.
