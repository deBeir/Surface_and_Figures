# SURFACE AND FIGURES

## ABOUT
A project developed as an assignment for the 'Introduction to Programming' class.
This simple program generates a surface with a given dimension and allows the user to insert circles and rectangles inside of it, avoiding the overlap of figures. 

For this project three classes were developed:
- *__```Surface```__*: generates the surface where all figures will be inserted. Has several methods to place them in valid positions:
  - figures can't be placed outside the edges of the surface; 
  - two or more figures cannot overlap.
- *__```Rectangle```__*: generates a rectangle.
- *__```Circle```__*: generates a circle.

There's also a *test* module developed to test all functionalities of the 3 classes. 

__Please note__, this is a beginner project, so many aspects need to be (greatly) improved. For example, the circles are placed inside the surface as if they're squares instead of actual circles.
